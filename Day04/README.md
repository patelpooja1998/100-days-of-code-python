# Day 4 - For Loop and Range() function
## Concepts Practised
- For Loop
- Increment Operator
- Range() function

  
# File 1 - Main.py

We are going to write a program that calculates the sum of all the even numbers from 1 to 100 using Range() function. Thus, the first even number would be 2 and the last one is 100:

i.e. 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 +10 ... + 98 + 100

Important, there should only be 1 print statement in your console output. It should just print the final total and not every step of the calculation.

# File 2 - password_generator.py

The program will ask:

How many letters would you like in your password?

How many symbols would you like?

How many numbers would you like?

The objective is to take the inputs from the user to these questions and then generate a random password.
